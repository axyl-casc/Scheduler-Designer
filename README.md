Welcome to the final project by **Axyl** and **Kevin** for COMP 3659!

We are excited to share what we've built and hope you enjoy exploring it as much as we enjoyed creating it.

## Overview

Our project simulates **non-preemptive CPU scheduling** and provides a dynamic, visual representation of how different scheduling algorithms operate. The interactive CPU state diagram offers an intuitive way to understand the behavior of these algorithms in real-time.

## Features on the Results Page

- A **Gantt Chart** displaying the processes as they run, including points where they switch due to I/O interrupts.
- **Box Plots** illustrating the time spent in each state (e.g., Ready, Running, Waiting).
- Detailed **CPU Statistics**, such as utilization, turnaround time, and other key performance metrics.
